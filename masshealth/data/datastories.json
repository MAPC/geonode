For individuals, a full analysis would include other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and diet. Reducing obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension in Massachusetts will take a combination of citizens choosing healthier habits, effective public policy, and thoughtful planning to make it easy and fun to get physical activity.\r\n\r\nClick here to explore all these visualizations in our advanced tool.\r\n",

Parks and other open space are important community assets for encouraging exercise and healthy lifestyles. This map shows that many communities with high obesity rates have open spaces -- such as parks, playgrounds, or beaches -- that might be used to help combat obesity. Although adding parks won\u2019t guarantee weight loss, combined with other policies it could play an important role in encouraging people to exercise more. In the next visualization, we take a closer look at the relationship between exercise, obesity and public recreation programming.\r\n",

The city of Boston is omitted from this visualization because it has much larger numbers of grocery stores and corner stores than other municipalities in the state. Typically, grocery stores offer more fresh produce and other healthy options at a lower cost compared to convenience stores. Access to healthy foods may be limited in communities with more corner stores than grocery stores, and these communities have higher levels of obesity. The Healthy Corner Stores initiative will help get more fresh produce into convenience and corner stores. Lowell, which we now know is a community that has a high proportion of adults not getting good nutrition, appears to also have a poor food environment based on its high number of convenience stores. Which communities do you think would be good candidates to launch Healthy Corner Stores initiatives? What other data would you need to make this decision?

The Community Transformation Grant aids communities to work with current tobacco control partners to reduce the number of people exposed to tobacco smoke, including both smokers who are seeking to quit, as well as those exposed to second-hand smoke. These initiatives include initiatives to create smoke-free multi-family housing, produce targeted and effective media campaigns, and educate youth about the harms of tobacco use. This data story explores data about smoking and the location of affordable housing in the state.</p>",
