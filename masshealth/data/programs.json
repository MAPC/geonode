With two active and curious boys, Joseph and Trudy, Jamie is in constant need of fun, safe places the three of them can visit to be active and outdoors.</p>\r\n<p>But while Fitchburg has 39 different parks offering many activities for youth, these haven&rsquo;t always been viable options for the Valdez family. Most of them remain untouched due to what many consider an unsafe image (used needles and syringes, graffiti, burnt trash cans, and isolated park areas). Safety, however, wasn&rsquo;t the only issue keeping people like Jamie away. A lot of people don&rsquo;t even know these parks exist. &ldquo;The children living here are in desperate need of safe options for physical activity that are close to their neighborhoods,&rdquo; stated AynYeagle, the Fun n&rsquo; FITchburg Mass in Motion coordinator.</p>\r\n<p>Fun n&rsquo; FITchburg conducted an in-depth park assessment, and then ran a long-term media campaign, encouraging community members to learn about these parks and volunteer for an adopt-a-park program to keep the areas safe and clean. Jamie Valdez was one of the first to volunteer for the adopt-a-park program. &ldquo;I wanted to help out with the community, but selfishly, I also wanted a safe place for my kids to play,&rdquo; says Jamie. Since then, they&rsquo;ve been catching, tagging, and Simon says-ing on the weekends and several week days after school. &ldquo;Not only do I not have to worry about my kids being safe, but I also don&rsquo;t have to worry that they&rsquo;re spending all their free time in front of the TV and video games.&rdquo;</p>",

By September 29, 2016, Cambridge will increase the number of school districts that have implemented nutritional guidelines that exceed the basic Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines. This strategy will improve nutrition for the children enrolled in the Cambridge school districts. The revised guidelines should have more stringent standards and/or expanded hours and settings covered by guidelines. Cambridge has introduced more fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans on public school menus and aligning menus to meet new state and federal regulations.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www3.cpsd.us/sustainability/food\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge Public Schools Food Initiatives</a></p>",

In Massachusetts, almost 1 in 10 households have trouble accessing healthy foods. People who don&rsquo;t have easy access to healthy food are more likely to be overweight, and have a higher risk for diabetes and heart disease. With this in mind, the Franklin Mass in Motion team, Healthy Futures Franklin, dug in their heels, picked up their shovels, and decided to build a community garden. A community garden would provide Franklin with fresh and affordable healthy fruits and veggies; a way to get to know friends and neighbors; and a learning experience for families struggling with poor nutrition.</p>\r\n<p>View Mass in Motion Update about Community Garden Project (coming soon)</p>\r\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/usdagov/3996515352/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Image credit</a>)</p>",
